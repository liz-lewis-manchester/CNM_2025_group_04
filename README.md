# CNM_2025_group_04 – River Pollutant Transport Model

This repository contains the group coursework for CNM 2025.  
The task is to simulate the 1D transport of a pollutant in a river using the advection equation:

∂C/∂t + U · ∂C/∂x = 0

The project integrates numerical modelling, Python programming, GitHub collaboration, and scientific reporting.
