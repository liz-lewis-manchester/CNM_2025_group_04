# CNM_2025_group_04 – River Pollutant Transport Model

This repository contains the group coursework for CNM 2025.  
The task is to simulate the 1D transport of a pollutant in a river using the advection equation:

\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + U \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = 0
\]

The project integrates numerical modelling, Python programming, GitHub collaboration, and scientific reporting.
